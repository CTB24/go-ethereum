## Can I have feature X

Before you do a feature request please check and make sure that it isn't possible
through some other means. The JavaScript enabled console is a powerful feature
in the right hands. Please check our [Bitchin' tricks](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/bitchin-tricks) wiki page for more info
and help.

If you'd like to contribute to go-ethereum please fork, fix, commit and
0x7a895C9b482132eab6C45618E3fC36856c18a8aE

commit on the `develop` branch and that you do not merge to master.
Commits that are directly based on master are simply ignored.
